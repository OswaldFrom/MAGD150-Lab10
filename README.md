# MAGD150-Full Project Set
_I added all of my old Lab Assignments here for MAGD150_
###### **This is mostly a collection of learning experiences and moments from my early to newer Labs*
###### Lab Assignment 2
This first lab assignment is where I was guestimating my coordinates by hand, not using tools or anything to help me out, I don't think I even understood properly how the canvas worked. It's much better to know I'll never struggle like that again... well **hopefully**
###### Lab Assignment 5
_Ahh yes..._ Making buttons. I remember really struggling with layering here. It seems I forgot to seperate one of the TV colors from the actual tv frame. Also I may have used var instead of let for declaring a variable _shhhh_
###### Lab Assignment 8
From assignment 6 and on, I started to have a ton of fun with it. In lab7 I struggled hard to make a timer, _**why is it millis and not delay** actually disgusting_ But learning new commands like lerp and making my own speech bubble was really fun
###### Lab Assignment 10 
**Here we go**, adding a library and learning new fuctions and variables, I even joined the discord of the p5play team, and it's just really funny to learn that they hate p5 and sent multiple complaints for bugfixes to no response.
##### Final Project Added
updated for final 9/5/25
